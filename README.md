# About this project

In this project I am exploring how I can enhance the transparency of Japanese politics further by collecting the data related to the voting patterns of the politicians as well as visualizing these voting patterns. You can see the demo video on youtube [here.](https://youtu.be/6PBbP3SSkhA)

So far I have,

* Scraped the voting patters of the different parties using selenium from the Sangiin website.(<https://www.sangiin.go.jp/japanese/touhyoulist/touhyoulist.html/>)

* Fetched the arguments of the parties(討論) from the api provided by the National Diet Library.(<https://kokkai.ndl.go.jp/api.html/>)

* Created an API hosting the above information and deployed it on heroku.(<https://sangiin-api.herokuapp.com/>)

* Created a frontend displaying the collected data and deployed it on heroku(<https://sangiin-frontend.herokuapp.com/>)
