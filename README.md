# About this project

In this project I am exploring how I can enhance the transparency of Japanese politics further by collecting the data related to the voting patterns of the politicians as well as visualizing these voting patterns.

So far I have,

* Scraped the voting patters of the different parties using selenium from the Sangiin website.(<https://www.sangiin.go.jp/japanese/touhyoulist/touhyoulist.html/>)

* Fetched the arguments of the parties(答弁) from the api provided by the National Diet Library.(<https://kokkai.ndl.go.jp/api.html/>)

* Created an API hosting the above information and deployed it on heroku.(<https://sangiin-api.herokuapp.com/>)

* Created a frontend displaying the collected data and deployed it on heroku(<https://sangiin-frontend.herokuapp.com/>)
