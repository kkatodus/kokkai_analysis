# About this project

In this project I am exploring how I can enhance the transparency of Japanese politics further by collecting the data related to the voting patterns of the politicians as well as visualizing these voting patterns. 

Currently I am using selenium to crawl the website of the House of Councillors in the Japanese Diet to generate .json files to source my data from. The code for this can be found in /utilities directory.
